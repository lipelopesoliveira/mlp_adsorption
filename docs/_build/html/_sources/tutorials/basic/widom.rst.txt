Widom insertion

Breafly introduction about Widom insertion method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Widom insertion method is a powerful and computationally efficient technique in statistical mechanics used to calculate the excess chemical potential of a species at infinite dilution. The method operates by inserting a "ghost" or "test" particle at random positions and orientations within a static configuration of a host system, such as a porous material. For each insertion, the interaction energy between the ghost particle and the host is calculated, but the particle is not actually added, so the host's configuration remains unchanged. By averaging the Boltzmann factor of these interaction energies over thousands or millions of trials, one can directly compute the **Henry's constant**, which is fundamentally related to the material's affinity for the adsorbate at low pressures, and the **Isosteric Heat of Adsorption at zero coverage (Qst)**. Furthermore, the distribution of insertion energies reveals the potential energy landscape, identifying the coordinates of the most stable adsorption sites within the framework.

This makes the Widom method arguably the easiest and most direct way to test a new Machine Learning Potential (MLP) for adsorption applications. Unlike full Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations, it does not require lengthy equilibration or the simulation of multiple interacting guest molecules. The method yields two crucial, physically meaningful metrics: the most stable binding configurations and the enthalpy of adsorption. These two outputs can be directly compared with high-fidelity experimental data from microcalorimetry and diffraction techniques, or with results from expensive quantum mechanical calculations, providing a robust and computationally inexpensive first-pass validation of the MLP's accuracy in describing host-guest interactions.

Setting the stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example we will evaluate the Mg-MOF-74, a material well-known for having adsorption of CO :sub:`2` on Open-Metal sites, which is very hard to model with classical force fields and usually require electronic structure methods, such DFT, to describe the interaction properly. 

On the ``flames/examples/Basic/1-Widom`` folder you will find the ``cif`` file for the Mg-MOF-74 [1]_. The simulation will be executed with the machine learning potential MACE [2]_, using the ``medium-0b2`` pre-trained foundation model with ``D3(0)`` dispersion correction. 

.. warning:: This model is used here just as an example, you should look carefully into the mace documentation to undestand how the potential work and which one is the best for your specific case.

The script below will run the simulation at 298 K (25°C).

Breaking down the input script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importing libraries
-------------------


.. code:: python

    import os

    # Hide UserWarning and RuntimeWarning messages
    import warnings

    import ase
    import torch
    from ase.data import vdw_radii
    from ase.io import read
    from mace.calculators import mace_mp

    from flames.widom import Widom

    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning)
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=RuntimeWarning)

    os.environ["KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK"] = "TRUE"

    
This first part only import the libraries and make the code to ignore a few non-important warnings from mace.
The ``os.environ["KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK"] = "TRUE"`` command is ony important on Windows machines. If you are running on Linux, this command will just be ignored.

Here the ``vdw_radii`` from ``ase.data`` is imported to calculate the smaller distance allowed between two atoms.

----

Defining the calculator
-----------------------

.. code:: python

    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

    model = mace_mp(
        model="medium-0b2",
        dispersion=True,
        damping="zero",  # choices: ["zero", "bj", "zerom", "bjm"]
        dispersion_xc="pbe",
        default_dtype="float32",
        device=device,
    )


This is an extremelly important part, as the ``calculator`` will be used to calculate the energy of interaction between the adsorbate (CO2) and the adsorbent (Mg-MOF-74). 
If you are running on GPU (which is extremelly recommended) you need to define the device correctly, so the calculator use the GPU. Currently, basically all MLPs only use a single GPU.

Here the pre-trained model ``medium-0b2`` is used, but currently there are several other variations available. For a complete list, check the mace-foundation repository: https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-foundations.

For a list of available models, check https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace/blob/100a29149d90a5945eddec1f0940bd88a6e3b363/mace/calculators/foundations_models.py#L19. You can also run a local model, just passing the path of the model instead of the name to the variable ``model``.

Reading the structure
---------------------


.. code:: python

    framework = read("mg-mof-74.cif")

    adsorbate = Adsorbate(
        name="CO2",
        structure="co2.xyz",
    )

This part of the code will read the framework and the adsorbate files. It uses the ``read`` function from ``ase``, which is very powerful and can read most file formats. 
Here, just make sure that the framework file is in a file format that is compatible with periodic boundary conditions and has a unt cell correctly defined.

For the adsorbate, a `Adsorbate` object is created, which will be used to define the adsorbate molecule. The ``structure`` parameter is the path to the file that contains the adsorbate structure.
The file can be in any format that is compatible with ASE, such as ``xyz``, ``cif``, ``vasp``, etc.

In case you want to make sure that your framework was read properly, you can create a separate python script and visualize the structure with the ``ase`` visualizator:

.. code:: python

    from ase.io import read
    from ase.visualize import view

    FrameworkPath = "mg-mof-74.cif"

    # Load the framework structure
    framework: ase.Atoms = read(FrameworkPath)  # type: ignore

    # Visualize the framework structure
    view(framework)


Running the simulation
----------------------

.. code:: python

    Temperature = 298.0
    NSteps = 3000

    widom = Widom(
        model=model,
        framework_atoms=framework,
        adsorbate_atoms=adsorbate,
        temperature=Temperature,
        device=device,
        vdw_radii=vdw_radii,
        debug=False,
        output_to_file=True,
        random_seed=42,
        cutoff_radius=6.0,
        automatic_supercell=True,
    )

    widom.logger.print_header()

    widom.run(NSteps)
    widom.logger.print_summary()
    widom.save_results()


Finally, this block defines the ``widom`` simulator and runs the code. You can define the ``Temperature`` and the number of Monte Carlo steps ``NSteps``.

Here we are using 3.000 for example, but it is recommended that you use way more steps for a serious simulations, and check if in fact your results are equilibrated. Usually 100.000 is a good starting point, but it strongly depends on the system.

You should change the ``cutoff_radius`` according to your system and potential used, usually 6.0 Å is a good starting point but check carefully the cutoff of your potential.
The ``automatic_supercell`` option will create a supercell big enough to fit the cutoff radius, so you don't need to worry about that.

This section provides detailed information about the framework and adsorbate, including their compositions, masses, energies, volumes, densities, and atomic positions.

It also lists the shortest distances between different atom types in the system, which can be useful for understanding potential interactions. Always check these distances to make sure there are no unphysical overlaps or if it does not prevent desired interactions.

Additionally, conversion factors are provided to facilitate the interpretation of simulation results in various units. For Widom simulations these factores are not used, but they are printed for reference.

Here the main simulation output is presented. For each Widom insertion step, the change in energy (dE) upon inserting the ghost particle is reported in both eV and kJ/mol.
The Henry's constant (kH) and isosteric heat of adsorption at zero coverage (dH) are calculated based on the average Boltzmann factor of the insertion energies up to that point. The time taken for each insertion step is logged, allowing users to monitor performance.
