# Changelog

## v[0.4.9] - 2026-07-23

### New Features 🎉

- Add `MoveWeights` class for managing and normalizing movement weights in simulations. This class allows users to define weights for different types of moves (insertion, deletion, translation, rotation, reinsertion, and identity change) and ensures that they are normalized to sum to 1. It also provides a method to select a move based on the defined weights using a random generator.
- Now it is possible to save only the adsorbate positions in the `Widom` simulations by setting the `save_only_adsorbate` parameter to `True` when initializing the `Widom` class. This feature allows users to save only the positions of the adsorbate molecules during the Widom insertion process, which can be useful for analyzing the behavior of the adsorbates without saving the entire system state. When set to `False`, the full system state will be saved, including both the framework and adsorbate molecules. The default value for this parameter is set to `False`, meaning that the full system state will be saved unless specified otherwise by the user.
- Add a new `Adsorbate` class to manage adsorbate molecules in the simulations. This class allows users to define adsorbate molecules, their structures, and associated properties such as name, equation of state (EOS), and move weights. The `Adsorbate` class provides methods for retrieving random configurations of the adsorbate molecules, facilitating their use in GCMC and Widom simulations. It also supports reading adsorbate structures from files and allows for flexible management of multiple adsorbate configurations.
- Added a warning method in `Logger` to print warnings to the output file. It also prints all warnings of the simulation at the end of the simulation. This feature helps users identify potential issues or concerns during the simulation process, allowing for better monitoring and debugging of the simulations.
- Added support for multiple adsorbates in the `GCMC` classes. Users can now specify a list of `Adsorbate` objects when initializing this class, allowing for simulations involving multiple types of adsorbate molecules. The simulation will handle the insertion, deletion, translation, and rotation moves for each adsorbate type based on their defined move weights and mol fractions.
- Added Nose-Hoover and Langevin termostats to the `BaseSimulator` class for NVT and NPT Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
- Added a custom `MTKNPT` implementation for molecular dynamics simulations with fixed cell volume but flexible cell shape. This implementation allows for anisotropic volume changes while maintaining a constant cell volume, providing more flexibility in simulating systems with varying cell shapes.
- Added NVE molecular dynamics using the Velocity Verlet integrator to the `BaseSimulator` class. This allows for energy-conserving simulations in the microcanonical ensemble, where the total energy of the system remains constant over time.
- Added NVE, NPT and MVT Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations as possible MC movements in the `GCMC` class. This allows the integration of MD simulations into the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, enabling the exploration of the system's phase space through both Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics methods.

### Enhanced ✨

- Use the `vesin` library to check for atom overlaps during the insertion of adsorbates in the GCMC and Widom simulations. The `vesin` library provides a more efficient method for calculating distances, prividing around 10x speedup in the overlap checking process. From the practical point of view, this change should provide only a minor speedup in the overall simulation time, as this process took only 30 ms on average for 2000 atoms, and now takes only 3 ms. However, this change improves the overall efficiency of the code and reduces the computational overhead associated with overlap checking.
- Improve the `BaseEOS` and `PengRobinsonEOS` classes for better reuse.
- Added new tests for the `PengRobinsonEOS` to compare the results with `RASPA2` and ensure the accuracy of the calculations. The tests include comparisons of fugacity coefficients and bulk phase densities for different gases at various temperatures and pressures, providing a comprehensive validation of the EOS implementation.
- Added warnings for energy differences that exceed the maximum allowed threshold during GCMC simulations. If the energy difference between the trial and current state exceeds the specified `max_deltaE`, a warning message is printed to inform the user of the potential issue. This helps users identify and address situations where large energy changes may indicate problems with the simulation or model.
- Improve the `identity_swap` movements to swap two different adsorbates in the system.

### Fixed 🐛

- Now the default value for `shifted` parameter in the `CustomLennardJones` and `CustomGNP` calculators is set to `False`. This change ensures that the Lennard-Jones and GNP potentials are not shifted by default, which may be more appropriate for certain simulations. Users can still set this parameter to `True` if they wish to apply a shift to the potential.
- Fixed the incorrect warning message for ideal supercell size in logger.

### Documentation 📖

- New examples for using the `CustomLennardJones` and `CustomEwald` calculators in GCMC and Widom simulations have been added to the documentation. These examples demonstrate how to set up and run simulations using these calculators, providing users with practical guidance on their usage.
- Improved the online documentation for the code with additional explanations and examples for the new features and enhancements introduced in this release.

### Modified 🛠

- Moved the `CustomLennardJones` and `CustomEwald` calculators to the `flames.calculators.lennard_jones` and `flames.calculators.ewald` modules, respectively. This change improves the organization of the codebase and makes it easier for users to locate and use these calculators in their simulations.
️- Moved the `LLM` parameter in the `GCMC` class to the `save_results` method. This change allows users to specify whether to use the Left-most Local Minima (LLM) method for equilibration analysis when saving the results of a GCMC simulation, providing greater flexibility in how the results are analyzed and reported. The default value for this parameter is set to `False`, meaning that the LLM method will not be used by default unless specified otherwise.
️- Now the enthalpy of adsorption calculation in the `utilities.enthalpy_of_adsorption` function includes the average adsorbate energy in the calculation. This change ensures that the enthalpy of adsorption can be calculated accuratly for flexible molecules.
- Add a warning message when the Berendsen termostat/barostat is used in combination with GCMC simulations. The warning informs users that the Berendsen method may not be suitable for GCMC simulations and suggests using the MTKNPT or Nose-Hoover methods instead. This helps users make informed decisions about the choice of thermostat/barostat for their simulations.

### Removed 🗑️

- Removed the `max_overlap_tries` parameter from the `GCMC` and `Widom` classes. This parameter was previously used to limit the number of attempts for placing an adsorbate without van der Waals overlap. However, it may cause problems in the simulation leading to potential issues with sampling.

## v[0.4.8] - 2026-07-22

### New Features 🎉

- Now it is possible to use a different calculator for the MD simulation in the `BaseSimulator` class. The `calculator` parameter can be provided to the `npt` and `nvt` methods, allowing users to specify a different calculator for energy calculations during the MD simulation. If not provided, the default model will be used.

### Enhanced ✨

### Fixed 🐛

- Fixed a bug in the ase_utils.py file where the `output_interval` and `movie_interval` parameters were mixed up, resulting in incorrect logging intervals for the MD simulations. Now the `output_interval` is correctly used for logging the MD simulation data, while the `movie_interval` is used for controlling the frequency of snapshot saving.

### Documentation 📖

- Add an example on how to use a different calculator for the MD simulation in the `GCMC` class.

### Removed 🗑️

## v[0.4.7] - 2026-07-22

### New Features 🎉

### Enhanced ✨

- Changed the `BaseSimulator` class to multiply the total energy by the supercell size when calculating the adsorption energy. This change ensures that the adsorption energy is correctly calculated based on the total energy of the system, which includes contributions from all atoms in the supercell.
- Created a new `CustomLennardJones` calculator based on JIT for improved performance in calculating Lennard-Jones interactions.
- Created a new `EwaldSum` calculator based on JIT for improved performance in calculating electrostatic interactions.
- Add workarounds for loading and saving labels in ASE's Trajectory since it does not support custom arrays. Now the labels are saved in the `info` attribute of the Trajectory and loaded back into the Atoms object when reading the trajectory.
- Create new `CustomGNP` calculator to implemente the Generalized Nonbonded Potential (GNP) based on the work of Luo and Goddard III, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 1, 499-515.
- Now a message is printed when the `GCMC` tries to restart a simulation from a trajectory file that is empty or corrupted. This message informs the user that the last state of the simulation cannot be loaded, and that the simulation will start from scratch.

### Fixed 🐛

- Fixed a bug in the MD classes that was causing the `output_interval` and `movie_interval` parameters to be mixed up, resulting in incorrect logging intervals for the MD simulations. Now the `output_interval` is correctly used for logging the MD simulation data, while the `movie_interval` is used for controlling the frequency of snapshot saving.
- Fixed a bug in the `BaseSimulator` class where the `set_state` method was not properly updating the current system state, which could lead to inconsistencies in the simulation. Now the `set_state` method correctly updates the current system state with the provided state, ensuring that the simulation runs with the correct configuration.
- Improve behavior when the cif file does not have partial charges.
- Fixed the LennardJones parameters for the `UFF` force field.

### Documentation 📖

- Added the parameters `output_interval` and `movie_interval` to decouple those parameters from the `save_every` attribute.
- Added the `set_momenta` parameter to switch on/off the initialization of atomic momenta based on the input temperature.

### Fixed 🐛

### Documentation 📖

### Removed 🗑️

## v[0.4.5] - 2025-12-08

### New Features 🎉

- Added the `Reinsertion` move to the GCMC simulation. This move allows for the reinsertion of an adsorbate molecule that has been previously deleted, providing a mechanism to recover from unfavorable deletions and improve sampling efficiency.
- Added the `insert_molecules` method to the `GCMC` class. This method allows users to insert a specified number of adsorbate molecules into the simulation box at once, facilitating the initialization of the system with a desired loading.
- Added excess uptake calculation to the GCMC simulation results.
  - Added the `void_fraction` parameter to the `GCMC` class that allows users to specify the void fraction of the structure for calculating the excess uptake.
  - Added the `get_bulk_phase_molar_density` on the `PengRobinsonEOS` class to calculate the bulk phase molar density needed for the excess uptake calculation.
- Now it is possible to manually set the adsorbate and framework energy when initializing the `GCMC` and `Widom` classes. This allows users to provide pre-calculated energies for the adsorbate and framework.
- Added the `nPT_MTKNPT` method on ase_utils for running NPT Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using the MTK NPT thermostat/barostat. This method is now the default for NPT MD simulations in the `BaseSimulator` class.

### Fixed 🐛

- Remove the `max_overlap_tries` parameter from the GCMC class, as any value greater than 1 may cause problems on the GCMC simulation.
- Fix conversion factor for 'nmol' in BaseSimulator to account for supercell dimensions
- Remove the `save_frequency` parameter from the `Widom` class, to avoid confusion since the snapshots are now controlled by the `save_snapshots` parameter.
- Changed the default value for the LLM parameter in the GCMC class to False.
- Rename the `N_ads` attribute to `n_adsorbates` in both the `GCMC` and `Widom` classes for better clarity.

### Enhanced ✨

- Change the json output file name on the `GCMC.save_results` method to `results_<T>_<P>.json` if no file name is provided by the user.
- Add the `production_start` parameter to the `GCMC.equilibrate` method to allow users to specify the step from which the production analysis should begin. This provides greater flexibility in analyzing the simulation data and helps to exclude initial equilibration steps from the analysis, specially when running MD + GCMC simulations.
- Add the `save_snapshots` parameter to the `Widom` class to allow users to control whether to save the simulation snapshots during the Widom insertion process. When set to `True`, the simulation state and results will be saved every step; when set to `False`, they will not be saved. By default, this parameter is set to `True`.
- Now `move_weights` parameter is a property in the `GCMC` class, allowing for get and set methods to change the move weights after initialization.

### Documentation 📖

- Att online documentation for the code at https://lipelopesoliveira.github.io/flames/

### Removed 🗑️

## v[0.4.4] - 2025-11-04

- Added the `CustomLennardJones` calculator to calculate the Lennard-Jones interaction energy

### Fixed 🐛

- Fix the bug where the `output_folder` parameter was not being properly passed to the `BaseSimulator` on `GCMC` class.
- Fix a major bug in rotating molecules that have part of their atoms in one unit cell and parts in another.

### Enhanced ✨

- Introduced the `max_overlap_tries` parameter in `GCMC` and `Widom` classes to try `n` attempts for placing an adsorbate without van der Waals overlap. If a valid position is not found within the specified number of tries, the insertion is rejected. This applies to insertion, rotation and translation moves.
- Only create the `Trajectory_rejected.traj` file if the `save_rejected` parameter is set to `True` when initializing the `BaseSimulator` class.
- Abstracted a few methods on the `Widom` class for better code reusability.
- Refactor the results json to improve the clarity
- Both `Widom` and `GCMC` classes now saves the random seed and enlapsed time on the `results.json` file.
- Now the use of Left-most Local Minima for pyMSER equilibration can defined on the GCMC class through the `LLM` parameter. By default it is `True`.
- Now the molecular rotation are based on a unit vector on a sphere, using the method proposed by George Marsaglia in The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 1972, Vol. 43, No. 2, 645-646.

### Documentation 📖

- Fix a bug on the isotherm simulation example.

### Removed 🗑️

## v[0.4.3] - 2025-10-15

### New Features 🎉

- Added support for custom output folders in the `GCMC` and `Widom` classes. Users can now specify a custom folder for saving output files through the `output_folder` parameter. If not provided, a default folder named 'results_<T>_<P>' will be created based on the simulation temperature and pressure.

### Fixed 🐛

### Enhanced ✨

### Documentation 📖

### Removed 🗑️

## v[0.4.2] - 2025-10-14

### New Features 🎉

- Added the `GCMC.equilibrate` method to allow users to perform equilibration analysis separately from the main simulation run. This method uses the pyMSER library to analyze the uptake data and determine when the system has reached equilibrium.
- Added the `GCMC.save_results` method to save the results of the equilibration analysis to a JSON file. This includes key metrics such as average uptake, uncertainty, and enthalpy of adsorption.
- Allow for custom move weights in the GCMC simulation. Users can now specify different probabilities for insertion, deletion, translation, and rotation moves through the `move_weights` parameter when initializing the `GCMC` class. This provides greater flexibility in tailoring the simulation to specific systems or research needs.
- Improved the logging of Widom simulation results to include standard deviations for both the Henry coefficient and the enthalpy of adsorption. The standard deviations are calculated using 5-fold cross-validation, providing a more robust measure of uncertainty in the results.
- Added the `Widom.save_results` method to include standard deviations for the Henry coefficient and enthalpy of adsorption.
- Added the `save_rejected` parameter to both the `GCMC` and `Widom` classes. When set to `True`, this parameter enables the saving of rejected moves to a separate trajectory file, allowing users to analyze these configurations post-simulation.

### Fixed 🐛

- The %wt conversion factor was incorrectly calculated using a factor of 1e-3 instead of 1e-1. This has been corrected in the `GCMC` class and related calculations to ensure accurate representation of adsorption data in weight percent.
- The restart method in the `GCMC` class was not properly resetting the simulation state. This has been fixed to ensure that all relevant attributes are correctly reinitialized when restarting a simulation.

### Enhanced ✨

- Improved the handling of tags in the ASE Atoms objects for both the framework and adsorbate molecules. The framework atoms are now tagged with `0`, and adsorbate atoms are tagged with `1`. This tagging system helps differentiate between framework and adsorbate atoms during simulations and analyses. This is also a necessary step for future implementations of multiple adsorbates.
- Now the rotation movements are restricted to an arc of -15 to +15 degrees around an random axis instead of a full random rotation. This change aims to improve the acceptance rate of rotation moves in the GCMC simulation by making smaller, more controlled adjustments to the adsorbate positions. This angle can be adjusted by the user through the `max_rotation_angle` parameter when initializing the `GCMC` class.

### Documentation 📖

- Examples have been updated to save the results of the simulations using the new `save_results` method.

### Removed 🗑️

## v[0.4.1] - 2025-09-19

### New Features 🎉

- The final name of the package is now `FLAMES - Flexible Lattice Adsorption by Monte Carlo Engine Simulation`. The code repository, documentation site, and examples have been updated to reflect this change.

### Fixed 🐛

### Enhanced ✨

- Added a `max_deltaE` parameter to the `BaseSimulator`, `GCMC`, and `Widom` classes to prevent errors from the model during energy calculations. This parameter sets a maximum threshold for energy changes, ensuring numerical stability during simulations. The default value is set to 1.555 eV (150 kJ/mol).
- Change the `random_seed` parameter to pick a random integer between 1 and 1,000,000 if not provided by the user. This ensures the use of a valid seed for the random number generator, enhancing reproducibility in simulations.

### Documentation 📖

### Removed 🗑️

## v[0.4.0] - 2025-09-04

### New Features 🎉

- Added the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) to the `mlp_adsorption.eos` module.

- Now all movements are based on a `numpy.random.Generator` to ensure reproducibility. A `random_seed` can be provided to the `GCMC` and `Widom` classes for this purpose.
- New module for checking the overlap between atoms (`mlp_adsorption.operations.check_overlap`)
- A new `BaseSimulator` method created to abstract the system state management and general simulation logic.
- Now all the output of the simulations are managed by a `mlp_adsorption.logger` instance. It introduces:
  - `BaseLogger`: A base class for logging simulation information, including restart and iteration details.
  - `GCMCLogger`: A logger specifically for GCMC simulations, extending `BaseLogger` with additional functionality.
  - `WidomLogger`: A logger specifically for Widom simulations, extending `BaseLogger` with additional functionality.
- Now the `Widom` has a `restart` method to allow restarting a Widom simulation from a saved state. Since Widom does not insert adsorbates on the structure, it simply reads the existing list of insertion energies and use it to update the simulation statistics.
- Now the code uses [pyMSER](https://github.com/IBM/pymser) to evaluate the equilibration of the simulation and calculate the average uptake and enthalpy of adsorption.

### Fixed 🐛

- Fix the framework density calculation on `GCMC` and `Widom` class.
- Fix an error on the check if the optimization converged.

### Enhanced ✨

  - It reads the state from an existing `Trajectory` object, enabling the continuation of simulations without losing progress.
  - It reads the total uptake, total energy, and adsorption energy `npy` files for seamless simulation restoration.
- Now the `vdw_factor` can be set when initializing the `GCMC` class, allowing for more flexible control over the Van der Waals radii scaling. By default, it is set to 0.6.
- Add `flush=True` to print statements for immediate output in optimization and simulation logs

### Fixed 🐛

- Fixed the handling of NaN values in the Van der Waals radii in both `gcmc.py` and `widom.py` files to ensure that any NaN value is replaced by 1.5, preventing potential issues during simulations.
- Fixed unit for Henry constant on header and footer of Widom output. Now it correctly reports the unit as [mol kg-1 Pa-1].
- Change the energy return value in the `try_insertion` method of the `Widom` class to 1000 eV when there is a Van der Waals overlap and limit the number of insertion attempts to 100. This change ensures that the method prevents an infinite loop in the simulation.

### Enhanced ✨

- Restart of a GCMC simulation:
  - Now the `load_state` method in the `GCMC` class can load the state from a `Trajectory` object, allowing for restarting simulations from saved states.

- Add new examples for running GCMC simulations with different configurations, including:

  - Basic
    - Widom Insertion
    - Rigid GCMC
    - Rigid GCMC Isotherm
  - Intermediate
    - Geometry Optimization + GCMC
