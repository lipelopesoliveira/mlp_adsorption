- Replaces PDB output with ASE Trajectory for snapshot saving in `widom.py`.
- Removed the unused import of `write_proteindatabank` in `widom.py`.

### Documentation üìñ

- Added docstrings to all functions and classes in the `gcmc.py` and `widom.py` files.
- Updated the README file with examples of how to use the GCMC and Widom insertion methods.
